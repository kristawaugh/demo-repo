# Demo Repo for Stat 133
Copy and pasted the commands from Lab 6 https://github.com/ucb-stat133/stat133-labs/blob/master/2019-spring/lab06-git-basics.md into an Rmarkdown file and committed them here to practice setting up an R file using version control, and to keep my commands somewhere to refer back to in the future.
